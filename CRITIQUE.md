# Critique of Initial Implementation

The previous commit introduced a minimal GPT-2 training pipeline. While functional,
it lacked several features expected in a research-grade project. Below is a summary
of the main shortcomings and how the current revision addresses them.

1. **Dataset Loading**
   - *Issue:* Only supported eager loading of all data into memory.
   - *Fix:* Added streaming capability and an iterable dataset class to handle
     massive corpora efficiently.

2. **Training Script**
   - *Issue:* No learning-rate schedule, mixed precision or gradient accumulation.
   - *Fix:* Introduced `TrainingConfig`, mixed precision with `torch.cuda.amp`,
     cosine learning-rate scheduling and gradient accumulation for larger batch
     sizes.

3. **Documentation**
   - *Issue:* README lacked detail and did not reflect advanced usage.
   - *Fix:* Expanded README with explanations of streaming, scheduling and
     advanced launch commands.

4. **Code Style**
   - *Issue:* Minimal comments and limited modularity.
   - *Fix:* Added detailed docstrings and configuration dataclasses to make the
     code easier to extend.

These changes upgrade the project from a simple example to a baseline suitable for
PhD-level experimentation.
