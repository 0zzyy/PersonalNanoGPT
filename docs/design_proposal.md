# Advanced PersonalNanoGPT Architecture

This document proposes an extension of the minimal GPT implementation with the following advanced components:

1. **Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL)**
2. **Reward-Augmented Decoding**
3. **Self-Alignment with Domain Knowledge**
4. **Robust Estimation with Confidence Calibration**

The goal is to enhance alignment, controllability and reliability without greatly increasing computational complexity.

## 1 Offline Reinforcement Learning

Offline RL allows the model to learn from previously collected trajectories without on-policy interactions. We maintain a dataset of text sequences paired with scalar rewards reflecting desirable behaviour (fluency, factuality, etc.). Training optimises the policy to maximise expected reward under this dataset.

We adopt a **Reward-Weighted Behaviour Cloning** approach for simplicity: for each sequence $x_{1:T}$ with reward $r$, the loss is

$$L= -r \sum_{t=1}^T \log p_\theta(x_t\,|\,x_{<t}).$$

This formulation is a special case of offline policy gradient where importance weights are absorbed into the reward. Though less sample efficient than actorâ€“critic methods, it avoids instability when the behaviour and target policies diverge.

## 2 Reward-Augmented Decoding

Generation is guided by an auxiliary reward function $R(x_{1:T})$ assessing properties such as style or domain compliance. During autoregressive decoding we combine log-probabilities from the model with normalised reward scores:

$$\tilde{p}(x_t\,|\,x_{<t}) \propto p_\theta(x_t\,|\,x_{<t}) \exp\bigl(\beta R(x_{\leq t})\bigr).$$

The temperature-like coefficient $\beta$ controls the influence of the reward. In practice we compute rewards on candidate tokens and perform sampling or beam search on the adjusted distribution.

## 3 Self-Alignment with Domain Knowledge

Self-alignment refers to the model adapting its outputs to align with domain-specific constraints and prior knowledge. We introduce a lightweight mechanism:

- A dictionary of domain terms and their embeddings.
- An auxiliary loss encouraging attention to domain terms during training and decoding.

This design keeps the architecture simple while allowing easy injection of new domain vocabularies.

## 4 Robust Estimation and Confidence Calibration

We extend the model with calibrated uncertainty estimates. After training we perform **temperature scaling** on a held-out validation set to obtain a scaling factor $T$ that minimises negative log-likelihood. Predicted token probabilities are then computed as

$$p_{\text{cal}}(x_t\,|\,x_{<t}) = \mathrm{softmax}(z_t/T)$$

where $z_t$ are the logits. The entropy of the resulting distribution serves as a confidence metric. Higher entropy indicates lower confidence.

## Proposed Architecture

```
+-----------------------------+
|  Text/Reward Dataset        |
+-----------------------------+
           | (1) offline RL
+-----------------------------+
|   GPT Model (core)          |
+-----------------------------+
      |        |       |
      | (2) Reward-augmented decoding
      | (3) Self-alignment module
      | (4) Robust estimation/calibration
```

Components (2)--(4) operate at inference time and require only modest computation. Offline RL modifies the training loop but reuses the same GPT architecture.
